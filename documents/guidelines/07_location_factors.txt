Title: Location Factors
Category: Facility Management
Priority: 1

Every facility operates in a specific local context. Important external factors include:

- Catchment area (population, demographics)  
- Accessibility (transport, parking, walking distance, travel time)  
  â†’ As a benchmark: In Europe, customers are generally willing to travel up to 15 minutes to a facility; in the US, up to 25 minutes. This directly influences the size of the potential customer base.
- Competition (existing facilities, saturation)  
- Local sports culture and community engagement  
- Urban vs. rural considerations

Understanding these elements is critical for business planning, site selection, and marketing strategies.
