This area focuses on what services and programs a facility provides. It includes:

- Types of sports (squash, padel, pickleball, badminton)  
- Court types and related amenities  
- Coaching, events, tournaments  
- Targeted services (youth, seniors, competitive players)  
- Non-sport offerings (food, coworking, childcare)

Facility layout and proportion are critical:  
The ratio between total facility size and the number of courts has a direct impact on construction and operating costs. Benchmarks suggest:

- For squash: ~150 m² per court  
- For padel: ~300 m² per court  
- For pickleball and badminton: ~200 m² per court  

> Example: A 6-court squash facility should not exceed ~900 m². Going significantly above this reduces cost-efficiency.

Architectural factors also play a role in the customer experience:

- **Traffic flow**: Facilities should be designed to increase customer dwell time, as longer stays typically lead to higher secondary revenue (F&B, pro shop, etc.)  
- **Architectural alignment**: The concept must be reflected in the layout. For example, if the facility aims to function as a “Social Club”, larger locker rooms and common areas are essential .

A well-balanced, concept-aligned offering increases both usability and profitability.
