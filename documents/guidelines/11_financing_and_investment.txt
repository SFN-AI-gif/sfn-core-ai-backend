Title: Financing and Investment Models
Category: Facility Management
Priority: 1

Long-term success depends on a viable financial model and clear investor strategy. Key aspects are:

- Equity, debt and hybrid funding models  
- Grant programs and subsidies  
- Sponsoring and naming rights  
- Crowdfunding and community buy-in  
- Financial planning (break-even, liquidity, reserves)

The financial base shapes what is realistically possible in operations and growth.
