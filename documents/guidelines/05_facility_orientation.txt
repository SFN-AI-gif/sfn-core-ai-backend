Category: Facility Management
Priority: 1

Facility orientation refers to the fundamental purpose and operating model of a racquet sports facility. It defines the overall context for decision-making and operations.

Five common types (including hybrids) are:

- Commercial-Oriented  (private)
- Non-Profit (Community or Public Sector)  
- Members' Club  (private social club)
- Educational  (Universities, Colleges, Schools)
- Add-On (e.g. hotel, resort)

Each has different needs, structures, revenue models, and priorities. Responses must be adapted to the relevant type before further recommendations are made.
