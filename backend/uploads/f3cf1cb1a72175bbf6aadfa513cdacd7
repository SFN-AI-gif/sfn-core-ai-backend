Building a Padel Court: Essential Insights for First-Time Investors
Padel, one of the fastest-growing sports globally, requires meticulous planning and precision during court construction. This guide provides essential insights tailored specifically for first-time investors considering padel court construction.
Required Space and Local Regulations
Obtaining planning permission is a critical initial step, particularly for first-time investors, due to significant differences between indoor and outdoor padel courts:
•	Indoor vs. Outdoor Considerations:
o	Indoor padel courts typically involve fewer regulatory hurdles and structural complexities. Conversely, outdoor courts must withstand environmental elements, particularly wind loads, which significantly impact design and construction costs.
o	Outdoor courts may face additional regulatory requirements, such as community concerns over noise pollution and lighting restrictions. Improperly designed lighting can inadvertently illuminate surrounding areas, creating issues with local authorities and neighbors.
•	Local Regulations:
o	Each location can have specific regulations governing wind load management, noise abatement, and environmental impact. Consulting with local authorities early can prevent costly delays.
According to expert Wolfgang Denk, a padel court’s official dimensions are 20m by 10m internally. However, practical dimensions including foundational structures require at least 20.8m x 10.8m. Crucially, add 2m on each side for player run-off areas, making an optimal dimension about 21.8m by 12.8m per court. Ground preparation must ensure a stable, leveled base clear of debris.
Step 2: Planning and Design
Choosing the right court model influences both aesthetics and functionality. Popular court types include:
•	Club Court (standard with regular vertical steel supports).
•	Panoramic Court (minimal vertical supports, offering enhanced visibility).
•	Super Panoramic Court (no corner supports—recommended only indoors).
Wolfgang emphasizes that Panoramic Courts require thicker (12mm) glass compared to the standard 10mm glass for regular courts, due to fewer supports.
Step 3: Construction Essentials
Foundation: The Critical Factor
According to Wolfgang Denk, the foundation is the "absolute game changer" for padel court longevity and performance. Indoors, a concrete slab with a thickness of 20cm and a perfect screed finish is sufficient. However, outdoor foundations demand detailed attention:
•	Soil Investigation: Conduct a professional survey to determine appropriate foundation depth and type. Unanticipated ground conditions can drastically escalate costs.
•	Drainage: In Central Europe, drainage is critical. Drainage asphalt is ideal due to its smoothness, flexibility, and durability in fluctuating climates. Conversely, concrete drainage surfaces are less reliable due to vulnerability in freeze-thaw conditions.
In regions like Spain, foundations often involve a simple concrete slab with a minimal gradient for drainage.
Court Structure and Glass Walls
Outdoor courts necessitate secure anchoring due to wind loads, while indoor courts typically require less rigorous anchoring. Panoramic courts, especially outdoors, demand robust structural frameworks, often involving significant steel supports to withstand wind loads as mandated by Euro-Code regulations.
Surface Options
The playing surface profoundly affects player experience and maintenance requirements. Artificial turf dominates European and Spanish courts, prized for:
•	Safety and comfort
•	Consistent ball bounce
•	Minimal maintenance
Wolfgang notes recent technological advances, particularly curled fiber artificial turf, which significantly reduces sand dispersion and maintenance costs. Conversely, hardcourt surfaces—common in Argentina—offer faster gameplay but less comfort.
Step 4: Final Inspection and Testing
Upon completion:
•	Verify component quality and structural safety.
•	Conduct play-testing to ensure correct installation and functionality.
Additional Considerations
Lighting
Outdoor lighting must comply with local regulations concerning environmental impacts, including permissible illumination levels (often limited to 3,000 Kelvin to minimize wildlife disturbance). Proper coordination between construction firms and electrical installations is critical.
Common Pitfalls and Recommendations
•	Foundation Miscalculations: Ensure thorough initial soil testing to avoid unexpected costs.
•	Surface Maintenance Costs: Opt for modern curled artificial turf to minimize ongoing maintenance.
•	Glass Selection: Use thicker glass for courts with fewer supports to ensure safety and structural integrity.
By carefully considering these detailed guidelines, padel court builders can create optimal playing environments that stand the test of time.
